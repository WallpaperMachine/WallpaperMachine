/// `DisplayDesc::all()` in the engine reads the active displays, the main one,
/// and each display's bounds, pixel size and refresh rate from CoreGraphics.
/// This reads AppKit's copy of the same facts: the screens in order (the first
/// is the main display), each one's display ID, frame, backing scale and
/// refresh rate. AppKit keeps it in-process and updates it before posting
/// `didChangeScreenParametersNotification`; each CoreGraphics getter is a
/// window-server round trip, and this is read for every notification. An XDR
/// display posts one for every frame of an EDR headroom ramp, and headroom,
/// like the Dock and menu bar's working area, is not in here.
