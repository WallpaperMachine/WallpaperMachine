# Multi-display wallpaper layouts

**Settings → Displays → Display layouts** saves the wallpaper choices on enabled,
independent displays under a name. **Apply** restores the whole arrangement;
**Rename…** and **Delete…** manage the saved records. Deleting a layout leaves
current wallpapers alone. Empty and mirrored displays are excluded when saving.
Up to 64 layouts with 64 display assignments each are supported.

Layouts save wallpaper IDs and existing display selectors, plus display titles
for explanation. They do not save wallpaper properties, scaling, playlists,
automatic-selection rules, display enablement or mirror topology. Applying uses
each wallpaper's existing options for its destination. The user's Play/Pause stays
unchanged. Playlists and automatic rules keep running, just as after a manual Apply;
a later scheduled event can change the restored wallpaper.

## Copy and swap

Each enabled independent display that has a wallpaper offers **Copy or swap
wallpapers** when another eligible display exists. Choose the other display, then:

- **Copy wallpaper** applies the source wallpaper to the destination, leaving the
  source assignment unchanged. An empty destination is allowed.
- **Swap wallpapers** exchanges the two current assignments. Both displays must
  already have a wallpaper; no content or settings files are moved or copied.

The destination picker excludes the source, disabled and mirrored displays. Native
validation repeats these checks when the queued operation begins, so a stale panel
cannot redirect a request to another display. Empty destination choices disable
both actions. The buttons retain contextual accessible names and return focus to
the initiating control; failures focus their complete error in Display layouts.

## Missing resources and failure recovery

Every saved display and wallpaper must be available before any assignment changes.
A saved layout with a missing wallpaper, disabled/mirrored screen or disconnected
display remains visible with the reason and a disabled Apply button. Reconnecting
the display or reinstalling the wallpaper makes the same record usable again.
No screen is substituted by position or by matching its friendly title. The
`primary` selector keeps its existing app meaning; other selectors retain the
renderer identity used throughout display settings.

Copy, swap and layout application each hold one user-command queue turn. The
operation validates all targets and rejects pending edits on involved wallpapers,
then checks the assignments again after preparation and between changes. A later
manual wallpaper command waits for this operation, including any recovery, and
then wins on its own display.

If a switch fails or is cancelled midway, recovery restores the affected original
assignments, including an originally empty destination. Recovery does not overwrite
an unexpected third-party assignment or guess from an untrustworthy snapshot.
The result explicitly distinguishes verified restoration from displays that could
not be restored; those need inspection before retrying. There is no promise that
multiple WindowServer surfaces change on the same frame.

Only final, trustworthy assignment changes enter recent/previous history. A fully
rolled-back operation leaves history and manual automatic-selection overrides
untouched. If recovery remains incomplete, the confirmed final changes are recorded.
An explicit successful no-op still counts as a manual choice for automatic rules.

## Shortcuts and backups

**Apply Display Layout** in Shortcuts uses a searchable saved-layout picker. Siri
and Spotlight receive the same action, and a link can use:

```
wallpapermachine://layout?id=LAYOUT_ID
```

There is no `display=` parameter because the layout names all of its displays.
The command validates current display and library availability before applying.

Saved layouts use the allowlisted `WallpaperMachine.displayLayouts` preference.
Local backups include these records. Keep-existing restoration merges by layout
ID and retains local records with the same ID; ordinary display names are labels,
not filesystem paths or authorization to access content. Deleted wallpaper
references remain visible instead of being silently pruned into a partial layout.

## Spaces boundary

These are per-display layouts. [Follow desktop Space](spaces.md) separately keeps
wallpaper/playlist choices by Space UUID and reloads the active display on a desktop
change. Applying a layout is a manual override for the current visit. A layout does
not save that Space map or switch Spaces, and inactive desktops do not retain
separate live renderer instances. Actual OS transitions still need desktop verification.

## Code and verification

| Responsibility | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Records, bounded persistence and backup validation | `App/Services/Library/WallpaperDisplayLayoutStore.swift` |
| Capture, planning, preflight and verified recovery | `App/Services/Desktop/WallpaperDisplayTransfer.swift` |
| Bridge queue, clean-option checks and final history | `App/ViewModels/BridgeStoreDisplayLayouts.swift` |
| Panel actions/snapshot | `App/Views/ControlPanel/WebPanelDisplayLayouts.swift` |
| Settings UI | `WebUI/display-layouts.js`, integrated in `WebUI/settings.js` |
| Shortcuts | `WallpaperConfigurationIntents.swift`, `AutomationCommand.swift`, `AppDelegate.performAutomation` |

`WallpaperDisplayLayoutStoreTests` checks persistence, name/identity/size bounds
and unavailable references. `WallpaperDisplayTransferTests` covers capture,
copy/swap, stale preparation, validation before writes, failures after mutation,
empty restoration, external-choice preservation and cancellation cleanup.
`WallpaperDisplayTransferIntegrationTests` exercises the real BridgeStore with a
snapshot-updating test bridge: history, manual-choice callbacks, clean-edit
preflight, paused playback and a newer queued manual action.

`ControlPanelDisplayLayoutTests` drives an offscreen WKWebView through save,
rename, apply, delete, copy, swap, failed recovery feedback, Escape/focus return,
escaped names, unavailable displays and 760-point English/Chinese/Japanese layout.
`WallpaperBackupTests`, `AutomationCommandTests` and `AppAutomationTests` cover
backup merging, URL validation and catalogs. These tests create no desktop
wallpaper windows and do not prove real multi-monitor compositor transitions,
visible appearance, VoiceOver, Siri or Shortcuts registration.
