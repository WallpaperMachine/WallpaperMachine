"""Rewrite the READMEs' Supporter list from the website's sponsor wall.

The website lists every Supporter who turned the listing on in their account and
still holds a purchase that was not refunded, earliest first, and counts the ones
who stay private (https://www.wallpapermachine.app/#sponsors). It serves the same
list, names and months only, at /api/sponsors, with a version that changes whenever
the wall does, and draws the wall as one picture at /sponsors/wall: its portraits,
names and months on the brand wallpaper. This reads the list and rewrites the block
between the `supporters:start` and `supporters:end` markers under README.md's
"Thank you. To every Supporter." heading, and under its translation's in
README.zh-CN.md: the picture, linked to the wall, at /sponsors/wall?v=<version>, so
GitHub's image proxy fetches it again when the wall changes, with every listed name
and the count in its alt text. A Supporter who turns the listing on, off, renames it
or changes their picture is followed here too. Nothing outside the markers changes.

    python3 scripts/update_sponsors.py                       # read the live wall, rewrite the list
    python3 scripts/update_sponsors.py --check               # exit 1 when a list is out of date
    python3 scripts/update_sponsors.py --input sponsors.json # a saved answer instead of the wall

The Supporters workflow (.github/workflows/supporters.yml) runs it every hour and
commits the READMEs when the list changed. A failed or malformed answer, or a README
without its block, leaves every README as it was.
